# hibernate-training

Training project for main functionality covering and hands on.
This project focuses on implementing caching functionality in Hibernate to improve the performance and scalability of database operations. 
Hibernate caching allows for the temporary storage of frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated database queries.

Features:
1. First-Level Cache: Hibernate provides a first-level cache (session cache) by default, which stores the objects associated with the current session. This cache helps minimize the number of SQL queries by storing the entities loaded during a session.

2. Second-Level Cache: This project explores the configuration and usage of second-level caching in Hibernate. Second-level cache is shared across multiple sessions and allows for caching at the session factory level, providing broader data caching capabilities.

3. Query Caching: Hibernate supports query caching, which caches the results of database queries. This feature helps avoid the execution of expensive database queries repeatedly by storing the results in the cache.

4. Cache Providers: Hibernate supports various cache providers such as Ehcache, Infinispan, and Hazelcast. The project demonstrates how to configure and integrate different cache providers with Hibernate to leverage their features and optimize caching performance.
